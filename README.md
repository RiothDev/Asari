# ðŸ¤– Asari

> ðŸ“œ An application that extracts information with requests and sends it through discord webhooks using curl and C++.

# ðŸ’« Information

The application obtains the IP address of the computer on which the executable is running and sends it through discord webhooks, this application was only made for study purposes so I do not see the need to add additions, although I will be considering the idea of improving some things

# ðŸ“– Instructions

+ In the Asari > Main.cpp file, change the "webhook_url" variable to the URL of your webhook

+ Build the project and run the .exe file (It is necessary to have [curl](https://curl.se/) installed and be able to use it to build the executable)
